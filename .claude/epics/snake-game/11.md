# Task: Documentation & Deployment

## Description
Complete comprehensive code documentation with comments explaining game architecture and logic. Update README with full project information, controls, and deployment instructions. Deploy game to static hosting service (GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel) and verify production deployment works correctly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All JavaScript functions have explanatory comments
- [ ] Complex logic sections have detailed comments
- [ ] README.md updated with complete project information
- [ ] README includes game controls and how to play
- [ ] README includes deployment instructions
- [ ] Code follows consistent commenting style
- [ ] Game deployed to static hosting service
- [ ] Production deployment tested and verified working
- [ ] Deployment URL documented in README
- [ ] LICENSE file added (if applicable)

## Technical Details

**Code Documentation Standards:**
```javascript
/**
 * Game Loop - Main game loop using requestAnimationFrame
 * Implements fixed time-step for consistent gameplay across devices
 * @param {number} currentTime - Timestamp from requestAnimationFrame
 */
function gameLoop(currentTime) {
  requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);

  // Calculate delta time since last frame
  const deltaTime = currentTime - lastFrameTime;
  lastFrameTime = currentTime;

  // Accumulate time for fixed time-step updates
  accumulator += deltaTime;

  // Update game logic at fixed intervals (currentSpeed)
  while (accumulator >= currentSpeed) {
    update();
    accumulator -= currentSpeed;
  }

  // Render current game state
  render();
}

/**
 * Check for collision between snake head and walls
 * @returns {boolean} True if snake hit a wall, false otherwise
 */
function checkWallCollision() {
  const head = snake.segments[0];

  // Check if head position is outside grid boundaries
  return (
    head.x < 0 ||                  // Left wall
    head.x >= GRID_SIZE ||         // Right wall
    head.y < 0 ||                  // Top wall
    head.y >= GRID_SIZE            // Bottom wall
  );
}

// Configuration constants
const GRID_SIZE = 20;              // 20x20 grid
const CELL_SIZE = 25;              // Each cell is 25x25 pixels
const BASE_SPEED = 150;            // Initial game speed (ms per move)
const MIN_SPEED = 50;              // Maximum speed cap
const SPEED_MULTIPLIER = 0.92;    // Speed increase: 8% faster = 0.92x time
```

# Snake Game

Classic snake game built with vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.

## Description

A retro-style browser-based snake game featuring classic gameplay mechanics,
progressive difficulty, and local leaderboard tracking. Built with pure JavaScript
without any frameworks or external dependencies.

## Features

- Classic snake gameplay with grid-based movement
- Progressive difficulty (speed increases as you eat more food)
- Local leaderboard (top 10 scores saved in browser)
- Retro pixel art aesthetic
- Smooth 60fps performance
- Keyboard controls
- Pause functionality

## How to Play

### Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Move the snake (Up, Down, Left, Right)
- **Spacebar**: Start game, Pause/Resume during gameplay
- **P Key**: Pause/Resume during gameplay
- **L Key**: View leaderboard (from start screen or game over)
- **ESC Key**: Return to main menu
- **Enter**: Restart game (from game over screen)

### Gameplay
- Eat food (red squares) to grow longer and increase your score
- Avoid hitting walls or your own body
- Game speed increases every 5 food items consumed
- Try to achieve a high score and get on the leaderboard!

## Installation & Running

### Option 1: Direct File Access
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. Start playing!

### Option 2: Local Server (Recommended for development)
```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (with http-server)
npx http-server

# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## Browser Compatibility

Requires a modern browser with HTML5 Canvas support:
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## File Structure

```
snake-game/
├── index.html      # Main HTML structure
├── styles.css      # Visual styling
├── game.js         # Game logic and rendering
└── README.md       # This file
```

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: None (Vanilla JavaScript)
- **Rendering**: HTML5 Canvas API
- **Storage**: localStorage for leaderboard
- **Performance**: 60fps with requestAnimationFrame
- **Bundle Size**: <100KB total

## Development

### Code Structure
- Game loop uses fixed time-step for consistent gameplay
- State machine manages game states (START, PLAYING, PAUSED, GAME_OVER)
- Modular code organization with clear separation of concerns
- No global namespace pollution

### Performance
- Targets 60fps on modern browsers
- Optimized canvas rendering
- Efficient collision detection
- No memory leaks during extended play

## Leaderboard

Scores are saved locally in your browser using localStorage:
- Top 10 scores are maintained
- Includes score and date for each entry
- Persists across browser sessions
- Can be cleared from leaderboard screen

## License

[Choose appropriate license: MIT, GPL, etc.]

## Credits

Created as a classic game implementation exercise.
