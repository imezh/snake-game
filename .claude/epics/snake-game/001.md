# Task: Project Setup & Structure

## Description
Initialize the snake game project with the foundational file structure and development environment. Create the basic HTML structure, CSS file, and JavaScript file scaffolding. Set up the HTML5 Canvas element and verify the development environment is ready for game implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Project directory created with proper structure
- [ ] `index.html` created with canvas element and proper HTML5 structure
- [ ] `styles.css` created with basic reset and canvas styling
- [ ] `game.js` created with module structure scaffolding
- [ ] `README.md` created with project overview
- [ ] Canvas element properly sized and accessible in JavaScript
- [ ] All files load correctly in browser without errors
- [ ] Basic canvas drawing test works (e.g., draw a rectangle)

## Technical Details

**Files to Create:**
```
snake-game/
├── index.html          # Main HTML structure
├── styles.css          # CSS styling
├── game.js             # Game logic (initially empty/scaffolded)
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

**index.html Requirements:**
- HTML5 doctype and semantic structure
- Canvas element with id (e.g., `gameCanvas`)
- Meta tags for viewport and charset
- Link to styles.css
- Script tag for game.js (defer or at bottom)
- No external dependencies or CDN links

**styles.css Requirements:**
- Basic CSS reset/normalize
- Canvas centered on page
- Responsive canvas sizing considerations
- Background color setup for retro aesthetic
- Font setup for UI text

**game.js Requirements:**
- Module pattern or IIFE to avoid global namespace pollution
- Constants for game configuration (grid size, cell size, colors)
- Canvas context acquisition and validation
- Basic initialization function
- Console log to verify script loading

**README.md Requirements:**
- Project title and description
- How to run (open index.html in browser)
- Browser compatibility requirements
- Development setup instructions
- License (if applicable)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Modern code editor (VS Code, Sublime, etc.)
- [ ] Modern browser for testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- [ ] Git for version control (optional but recommended)

## Effort Estimate
- **Size:** XS
- **Hours:** 2-4 hours
- **Parallel:** false (foundation for all other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All files created and properly linked
- [ ] Project opens in browser without errors
- [ ] Canvas element renders and is accessible via JavaScript
- [ ] Basic canvas test (draw a colored rectangle) works
- [ ] Code follows modular structure (no globals)
- [ ] README documents how to run the project
- [ ] Git repository initialized (optional)
- [ ] Initial commit made with project structure
